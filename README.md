## What is fuzzylli
fuzzylli is a tool to postprocess fuzzy dark matter (FDM) interference fringes
onto cosmic filaments. It does so by both adapting and unifying existing approaches for halo
interference reconstruction, most notably:

The result is a surrogate model for the FDM wave function in 
cylindrical symmetry. We refer to [our paper](#citing-fuzzylli)
for an in depth exposition of fuzzylli's underlying assumptions, physics and application
to cosmology.

fuzzylli is built on [jax](https://github.com/google/jax) such that compuation of observables 
involving the FDM wavefunction
(including its derivatives via `jax.grad`) are trivial (thanks to `jax.vmap`) and 
reasonably efficient (thanks to `jax.jit`).

The name is inspired by the Fussilli noodle (wavy long pasta). We gloss over the
fact that the final filaments look more like Rigatoni at the moment
:man_shrugging:.

Loosely related, fuzzylli also provides a differentiable jax implementation of
the ellipsoidal collapse model, making an end-to-end computation of mass
functions (filaments, haloes, sheets) possible without the need to invoke literature fit 
results.

**This is a research project. Expect bugs**

## Installation
fuzzylli is pre-alpha and currently meant as an internal tool. No real efforts
have been put into packaging at this point. Please install in development mode
via:
```console
$ git clone https://github.com/timzimm/fuzzylli.git
$ cd fuzzylli
$ pip install -e .
```

## Example
We refer to our [paper repository](https://github.com/timzimm/fdm_filaments) for
examples.
